Meeting Transcript — Ward 42 Constituency Office
Date: 26 February 2026

User: Good morning everyone. Let us begin.

Person 1: Sir, the drainage on the main road near plot 34 has been overflowing for two weeks now. What is the status of the repair work?

User: I am aware of this. I will personally follow up with the PWD commissioner today and ensure work begins by 5th March.

Person 2: Sir, the street lights in Sector 4 near the school have been broken for ten days. Families are scared to go out at night.

User: I will contact the electricity department this afternoon and get a timeline by Friday.

Person 1: Sir, the road repair near Ward 17 market that was promised last month — has any work started yet?

User: I will call Commissioner Singh directly today and demand a written update by end of this week.

Person 3: Sir, can you check whether the PM Awas Yojana applications from Ward 8 have been processed? Several eligible families are still waiting.

Person 2: Also sir, what is the current budget utilization for Ward 42 infrastructure this year?

User: The budget allocated for Ward 42 infrastructure this year is 2.3 crore. Only 80 lakh has been utilized so far. We need to move faster on this.

User: Ward 42 has a population of approximately 45,000. Drainage coverage is only 60 percent. The remaining 40 percent relies on open drains that overflow every monsoon.

Person 3: Sir, the drainage issue has been recurring every year for the last three years. Last monsoon around 200 families were affected near plot 34.

User: I know. This is a pattern and we need a permanent fix not just a patch repair. I will raise this with the PWD department formally this week.

Person 1: Thank you sir. We appreciate you hearing us.

User: Thank you all. Next meeting is on 10th March.
